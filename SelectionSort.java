/**
* Selection Sort
*
* Algorithm starts by assuming the first element of an array is the minimum
* The algorithm then iterates through all the remaining elements,
* continuously searching for the smallest, unsorted element and swapping it until it has been completely sorted
*
* Complexity: O(n^2)
* Good For: When simplicity is more important than time complexity
* But: Selection Sort is very slow and it's almost always better to use a faster sorting algorithm like Quick Sort or Merge Sort
